# pyRPG
Random Python RPG, all console based!
Controls: WASD to move, Space to cast current spell, E to interact, ESC to bring up menu. IJKL to attack directionally. Use UP ARROW or Q to move cursor up in a menu, use DOWN ARROW or E to move it down, use ENTER to select a menu option. Also, use U and O to cycle through equipped spell in multiplayer!

# Warnings:
This game is still under rapid development and saves from one commit will probably not work to the next commit. However, feedback given now will have a much larger impact on the end result than given later. Currently development is mostly stopped on single player - the lava dungeon will be finished and that's probably the extent of development there. Focus is going to multiplayer.

# Installation:
This game only runs on Windows systems. 
First, install Python 3.4 or later.
Next, drag the unicurses folder into the folder "Lib" under where you installed Python.
Run the pywin32 installer. Make sure it properly installs pywin32.
Run pyRPG.py

The server should run on any system, but is only being tested on Windows 7 32 bit right now.

# How to help:
If you want to help in the development of this game, just tell me!
If you know how to do any of these it would be a great help:
- Multiple platform support. So being able to get the state of the keyboard on linux based operating systems.
- Unicode support. Needs to be done for all platforms. Specifically, if you know how to do this on Windows *please* tell me! It will massively improve the game!
- Game design. Figuring out what is fun is hard!
