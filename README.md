# Play the game:
[Try out pyRPG!](https://fuzzything44.github.io/pyRPG/pyRPG_web/)  
Note: this requires a server running, so be prepared to clone it and start the server yourself.

# Warnings:
This game is still under rapid development and saves from one commit may not work to the next commit. However, feedback given now will have a much larger impact on the end result than given later. Currently development is stopped on single player - the lava dungeon may be finished and that's the extent of development there ever. Focus is going to multiplayer and the web client.
