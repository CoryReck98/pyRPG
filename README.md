# pyRPG
Random Python RPG, all console based!
Controls: WASD to move, Space to cast current spell, E to interact, ESC to bring up menu. IJKL to attack directionally.

# Installation:
I'll add a better guide to this later. For now, you need Python 3.4, unicurses, to run the win32 installer, and then you should be good.
